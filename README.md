# python-video-tools
A collection of python tools I've created to handle various video related issues or to assist in other projects.


## frame-grabber.py
You give it a list of video urls and it downloads the videos and grabs a random screenshot from each. A few things I've used this for:
- Checking for videos that had been resized incorrectly at some point, the thumb will have black borders where they shouldn't.
- Used for grabbing a lot of video frames for building datasets for machine learning projects.
